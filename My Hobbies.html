    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>My hobbies include a range of typical "nerdy" things such as:
    <ul>
        <li>Board Games</li>
        <li>Video Games</li>
        <li>Reading novels and biographies</li>
        <li>Journaling</li>
        <li>Drawing and Painting</li>
    </ul>
    I originally wanted to be an artist, hence my artistic education, and I find it
    important to continue to follow that passion as the creativity and design principles I learned enable me to approach
    web design and development with a keen eye for detail, color, and layout. </p>
